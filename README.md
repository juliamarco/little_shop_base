This project builds two extensions on top of Little Shop of Orders, a BE Mod 2 Week 4/5 Group Project at Turing School of Software and Design.

The original project consists of building a fictitious e-commerce platform where users can register to place items into a shopping cart and 'check out'. Merchant users can mark items as 'fulfilled', and Admins can mark orders as 'complete'. Each user role will have access to some or all CRUD functionality for application models.

The two extensions built are Coupon Codes & Merchant Stats Charts.

## Coupon Codes

### The general goal of this extension is that Merchants can generate coupon codes within the system and user can apply these coupons.

As a merchant, you have access to a "My Coupons" link, where you can manage your coupons
